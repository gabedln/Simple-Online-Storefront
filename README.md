# Simple Online Storefront
### CMSC 22: Final Project
After multiple bad experiences with existing online storefronts, the client has decided to develop one of their own instead.  The developed online storefront will offer the basic set of functionality one would expect from one. The project shall utilize and be implemented through JavaFX, to create a user interface to deliver a dynamic and interactive experience. Additionally, the client requires that the online storefront be usable, aesthetically pleasing, and easy to navigate for its users.
